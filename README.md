### Project Overview

#### The Problem Area:
The past decade has seen the individual consumer market become increasingly saturated with online
food delivery apps; their expansion only spurred by the onset of the global pandemic. The growth of
industry giants such as Uber Eats and Skip the Dishes has not only allowed its users access to hundreds if
not thousands of restaurants at their fingertips but also helped the struggling restaurant sector weather
the waves of lockdowns, with many restaurants opting to go entirely delivery based.
While these food delivery apps do segregate restaurants into specific categories (ex; types of cuisines,
dietary restrictions, on sale), they lack detailed specifications and tend to catalogue restaurants
wholistically instead of by individual dishes.
My team intends to use an open-source API database of the most common restaurant offerings as well
as their macro nutrient profile to help recommend offerings which fit into health-conscious consumers’
diet plans.

#### Our Target Audience:

Individuals in Pursuit of a Healthier Lifestyle

Our primary focus is on a demographic of individuals who are actively seeking to adopt a healthier lifestyle. It's a well-established fact that many embark on health and wellness journeys without the essential support systems required for sustainable success. In today's fast-paced world, online food delivery services have emerged as a popular means of meal acquisition. This paradigm shift in food consumption behavior necessitates the development of a sophisticated tool that seamlessly integrates with these services, creating a symbiotic relationship that offers users detailed, goal-specific recommendations.

As a potential investor, it's crucial to recognize the vast market potential that lies within this segment. The fusion of technology and health-conscious consumer behavior presents an exciting opportunity for NourishNavi, a solution poised to revolutionize the way individuals engage with their nutrition, enabling healthier, more informed food choices. We invite you to consider NourishNavi as an investment with the potential to transform the well-being of our target users while capturing a substantial market share in the health and wellness technology landscape.

#### The Big Idea:
Given that users input their daily targets as well as the macro count of food consumed up until that point
in the day, the extension would be able to sample dishes in the users’ surroundings and recommend
dishes based on filters that the user can choose in a hierarchical fashion. With the global health and wellness food market projected to bloom to a trillion dollars by 2026, brands like Sweet Green and Freshii will likely create brand deals with Uber to jump start this sector of online
food delivery. This will increase not only increase customer acquisition but also create a new niche for
health-centric businesses.

#### The Data:
I will be using three databases for this project: 
1) Nutrionix, which is the world’s largest verified nutrition database with over 209,000 restaurants with macros tracked for every item on the menu. https://www.nutritionix.com/
2) Food.com, which is a open database comprising off over 350,000 dishes indivudals can cook at home all the while being able to track their macros
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews
3) Local resturant data which will be scraped from food delievry apps. This will initially start with Uber Eats and then extend into other popular food delivery apps.

I have also added a data_dictionary for referencing the databases I am currently using and what their variables store.
